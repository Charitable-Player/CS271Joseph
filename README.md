1. Robotics
2. game development
3. web development

five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing,
1. These logic gates have been difficult to understand, I think I am doing my oder of operations wrong
2. I have trouble doing large complex programming problems. I try my best to break it up into smaller functions but I still find difficulty.
3. I think one topic thats difficult for the world is AI ethics especially with ChatGPT.
4. Quantum computing development
5. Coming up with new game ideas and mechanics. Most games feel too similar to previous games.
